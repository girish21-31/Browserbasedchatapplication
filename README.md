To start your Node.js application through the terminal, you have a few options depending on your setup. I'll guide you through the most common methods:
•  Using Node directly:
If your main file is server.js, you can start it directly with Node:
   node server.js
2. Using npm start:
If you've set up a start script in your package.json as described earlier, you can use:
   npm start
3. Using npm run:
If you have custom scripts defined in your package.json, you can run them with:
   npm run script-name
For example, if you have a dev script:
   npm run dev
Here's a step-by-step guide to start your application:
•  Open your terminal or command prompt.
•  Navigate to your project directory. Use the cd command to change directories:
   cd path/to/your/project
Replace path/to/your/project with the path to your project folder.
•  Once in the correct directory, you should see your server.js file when you list the contents (use ls on Mac/Linux or dir on Windows).
•  Now, try starting your server with one of these commands:
   node server.js
or
   npm start
(if you have set up the start script in your package.json)
5. If the server starts successfully, you should see output in the terminal, possibly including the message about which port the server is running on.

http://localhost:3000/

if you encounter a problem with the socket.io installation then go through

Here's a concise explanation and fix:
Remove this line from your JavaScript file.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command:
This command will install the express and socket.io packages, likely dependencies for your Browser-based chat app. After running this command, you can proceed with writing your actual JavaScript code that uses these packages.
